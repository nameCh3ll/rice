<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## :blue_book: Installation
A guide to installing the system and graphical shell via builder: [EN](Docs/01_installing_arch_linux_with_bspwm_english.md), [RU](Docs/00_installing_arch_linux_with_bspwm_russian.md). 


<!-- ERRORS -->
## :moyai: Post-installation fixes
Complete instructions for corrections: https://youtu.be/9zewiGf7j-A
* **The brightness of the screen is not displayed on the bar**. This error is due to the fact that the Builder was unable to automatically install drivers for the video card or processor. You need to go to [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and do the installation manually.
* **The battery is not displayed on the bar**. You need to open `~/bin/battery-alert` and change the `battery` variable to your battery value. Then go to `~/.config/polybar/modules.ini` and edit the `[module/battery]` module according to the polybar instructions to match your `battery` and `adapter` data.
* **Hangs animation or terminals**. The problem is that you may not be using graphics drivers or may be working from a virtual machine. You need to open `~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc` and comment out the line with the `picom` startup.
* **Interface problem**. If you are not using a `1920x1080 monitor`, the interface may not look like it should. In that case you need to manually edit the configuration.
* **User name error**. At this point, the configuration is installed locally on the user from where the builder was running. Also the username must be `user` for the system to work properly. If you get this error, you need to create a new user named `user` and redo the installation.
* **Other errors**. If you find bugs that aren't listed here and you're sure you followed the manual, then be sure to contact us so we can fix the bug in the next update.
